SimpleLibrary is a library ment to be used jar-in-jar to make modding a little easier and reduce the amount of step. Small little things found in SimpleUtils and DataHelper are ment to reduce hastle across multiple projects.

SimpleLibrary suports ForgeModLoader for 1.20.1 and will switch to NeoForgeModLoader for 1.20.2

There are plans to make it easier to add fabric/quilt suport to a mod too.
